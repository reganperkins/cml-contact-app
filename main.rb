# user_input = gets.chomp

# if input == 'help'
# list commands

# if input == 'new'
# prompt full name 
# prompt email
# add to contact_array[] (in a hash?) as strings
# then store contact in CSV file
# return new contact id

# Note: This does not mean that you need to 
# store an ID in the file. How can you represent 
# each row in the CSV as an ID?
